####How to Use: 
**Browser**: To use this in the browser(Chrome Command Line wtc...) simply copy paste the code in which ever file and run the function with input. Or place the function within a script in an html page and open the page in your browser.

**Node**: These functions were written to accept input arguments using node. If node is installed simply run the following node <filename> <arg1> <arg2>... The number of arguments will depend on the file. For example binarySearch.js would run as node binarySearch.js <sortedArray> <number_to_find>
